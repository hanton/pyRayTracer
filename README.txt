pyRayTracer
===========

pyRayTracer is a Ray Tracer in Python. I write it for learning speaking Python and Ray Tracing.

(functions) =
Camera : Pinhole Camera
Sampler: Multijittered Sampler, Regular Sampler
Texture: Image Texture
BRDF: Diffuse, Specular, Mirror Specular
Light: Ambient Light, Point Light, Direction Light, Ambient Occlusion, Area Light
Shadow
Geometry: Sphere, Plane


How to Run
===========
   python pyRayTracer                            - to render a default 640*320 with 4 pixel samples picture
or python pyRayTracer width height pixel_samples - to render a width*height with num_samples pixel samples picture

Use PyPy! itâ€™s 80x faster:
   pypy pyRayTracer                            - to render a default 640*320 with 4 pixel samples picture
or pypy pyRayTracer width height pixel_samples - to render a width*height with num_samples pixel samples picture

Profile:
to Screen
python -m cProfile -s time pyRayTracer <args>

or to File:
python -m cProfile -o output.file pyRayTracer <args>
